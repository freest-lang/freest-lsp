## How to install
Because the extension depends on the `freestlspserver` executable, independently of your 
installation choice, you will have to install the aformentioned executable by hand.
For this, you can either clone [this](https://github.com/freest-lang/freest-lsp-server) git repository
and follow its instructions, or download and run 
[this](https://github.com/freest-lang/freest-lsp/blob/main/install-lsp-server.sh) script
using `./install-lsp-server`.
