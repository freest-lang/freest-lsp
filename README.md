## How to install
Currently this extension is not available in VSCode's marketplace, so its 
 	installation is rather manual. First, one chooses and downloads the 
	preferred version (usually the most recent).
	From here, there are 2 ways to install the extension into VSCode: using 
	VSCode's 'Install from VSIX...' option, or a common terminal.

### Manual install from VSIX

1. Open the 'Extensions' tab of VSCode
2. Open 'Views and More Actions...' at the top
3. Select 'Install from VSIX...'
4. Choose the extension's .vsix file
5. You're all set!

### Terminal

1. Open a terminal of your choosing
2. Run the command `code --install-extension <path to extension vsix>`
